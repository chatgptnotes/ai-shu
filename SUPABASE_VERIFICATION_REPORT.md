## 4. Row Level Security (RLS) Verification

### Status: ⚠️ ENABLED BUT NEEDS REVIEW

RLS is enabled on all tables, which is correct. However, during testing, we observed that unauthenticated access to `student_profiles` was allowed, which may indicate the policies need to be stricter.

### RLS Status by Table

| Table | RLS Enabled | Policies Count | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| user_profiles | ✅ Yes | 3 | ✅ |
| student_profiles | ✅ Yes | 4 | ⚠️ |
| parent_profiles | ✅ Yes | 3 | ✅ |
| sessions | ✅ Yes | 2 | ✅ |
| messages | ✅ Yes | 2 | ✅ |
| whiteboard_snapshots | ✅ Yes | 2 | ✅ |
| diagnostic_tests | ✅ Yes | 1+ | ✅ |
| quizzes | ✅ Yes | 1+ | ✅ |
| quiz_submissions | ✅ Yes | 2 | ✅ |
| mastery_tracking | ✅ Yes | 1+ | ✅ |
| progress_reports | ✅ Yes | 1+ | ✅ |
| homework | ✅ Yes | 1+ | ✅ |
| milestones | ✅ Yes | 1+ | ✅ |

### Verified Policies

#### `student_profiles` Policies
1. ✅ **Students can view own profile** (SELECT)
   - Users can view their own profile via `user_id = auth.uid()`
   - Parents can view their children's profiles

2. ✅ **Students can update own profile** (UPDATE)
   - Users can update only their own profile

3. ✅ **Students can insert own profile** (INSERT)
   - Users can create their own profile during signup

4. ⚠️ **Potential Issue**: Unauthenticated access was allowed during testing

#### `sessions` Policies
1. ✅ **Students can view own sessions** (SELECT)
   - Students can view their own sessions
   - Parents can view their children's sessions

2. ✅ **Students can insert own sessions** (INSERT)
   - Students can create sessions for themselves

#### `messages` Policies
1. ✅ **Session participants can view messages** (SELECT)
   - Students can view messages from their own sessions
   - Parents can view messages from their children's sessions

2. ✅ **Students can insert messages in own sessions** (INSERT)
   - Students can insert messages into their own sessions

### Security Audit Findings

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS**:

1. **Unauthenticated Access Warning**: During automated testing, unauthenticated queries to `student_profiles` succeeded. This could be due to:
   - A default policy that allows SELECT without authentication
   - The anon key having elevated permissions
   - RLS policies not being strict enough

2. **Recommendation**: Review all RLS policies in Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to: Database → Tables → [table_name] → Policies
   - Ensure all policies require `auth.uid()` for authentication
   - Remove any policies that allow anonymous access

3. **Service Role Key**: Ensure the service role key is NOT exposed in client-side code
   - Only use anon key on the frontend
   - Use service role key only in backend/server code

   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<paste-new-key-here>
   ```
6. Restart the development server

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING USER ACTION

### Warning Issues

#### 🟡 Issue 2: Supabase Config File Error
**Problem**: `config.toml` had invalid key `edge_functions` (should be `functions`)

**Resolution**: ✅ FIXED - Updated to use correct `[functions]` section

#### 🟡 Issue 3: Unauthenticated Access to Student Profiles
**Problem**: During testing, unauthenticated queries to `student_profiles` were allowed.

**Impact**: Potential security risk if this is a real policy issue.

**Resolution Required**:
1. Review RLS policies in Supabase Dashboard
2. Ensure all SELECT policies require `auth.uid()` is not null
3. Test with a fresh signup after fixing the API key

**Status**: ⏳ NEEDS VERIFICATION AFTER API KEY FIX
