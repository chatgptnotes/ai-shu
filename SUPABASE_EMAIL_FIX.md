# Supabase Email Verification Issue - URGENT FIX

## üö® PROBLEM

You're experiencing:
1. **"Invalid credentials"** error when logging in
2. Sign up says **"check your email"** but no email arrives
3. Cannot use the application at all

## üîç ROOT CAUSE

Your Supabase project has **Email Confirmations ENABLED** but **NO EMAIL PROVIDER** is configured to send emails.

What happens:
- When you sign up ‚Üí Supabase creates your account but marks it as "unconfirmed"
- When you try to login ‚Üí Supabase rejects because account is "unconfirmed"
- No email is sent ‚Üí Because email provider (SMTP) is not configured

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Disable Email Confirmations (FASTEST - Recommended for Testing)

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your AI-Shu project
3. Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers**

### Step 2: Configure Email Provider
1. Click on **Email** in the providers list
2. Scroll down to **Email confirmation settings**
3. **UNCHECK** "Enable email confirmations"
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Update URL Configuration
1. Go to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**
2. Set **Site URL**: `http://localhost:3002`
3. Add **Redirect URLs**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3002/**
   http://localhost:3000/**
   ```
4. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Clean Up Existing Users (Important!)
Since your previous signup attempts created "unconfirmed" users, you need to delete them:

1. Go to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
2. Find any users you created during testing
3. Click the **trash icon** to delete them
4. Or use SQL Editor and run:
   ```sql
   -- Delete test users (BE CAREFUL - only run in development!)
   DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';
   ```

### Step 5: Test Again
1. Clear your browser cache/cookies or use Incognito mode
2. Go to: http://localhost:3002/auth/signup
3. Sign up with a NEW email (or the one you just deleted)
4. Should immediately redirect to profile setup (NO email verification!)
5. Complete profile setup
6. You should land on the dashboard

## üîß ALTERNATIVE: Configure Email Provider (For Production)

If you want to enable email confirmations properly:

### Option A: Use Supabase's Default Email (Limited Free Tier)
1. Supabase provides a default email service for testing
2. It's already enabled, but has strict rate limits
3. Check if emails are going to spam folder

### Option B: Configure Custom SMTP (Recommended)
1. Go to: **Project Settings** ‚Üí **Authentication** ‚Üí **SMTP Settings**
2. Choose a provider:
   - **SendGrid** (12,000 free emails/month)
   - **Mailgun** (5,000 free emails/month)
   - **Gmail** (simple but has limits)
   - **AWS SES** (production grade)

3. Example with SendGrid:
   ```
   SMTP Host: smtp.sendgrid.net
   SMTP Port: 587
   SMTP User: apikey
   SMTP Password: YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY
   Sender Email: noreply@yourdomain.com
   Sender Name: AI-Shu
   ```

4. Save and test by sending a test email

### Configure Email Templates
1. Go to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Email Templates**
2. Customize these templates:
   - **Confirm signup** - includes {{ .ConfirmationURL }}
   - **Reset password** - includes {{ .ConfirmationURL }}
   - **Magic Link** - includes {{ .ConfirmationURL }}

3. Make sure the templates use the correct redirect URL:
   ```html
   <a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Confirm your email</a>
   ```

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

After disabling email confirmations:

- [ ] Delete all existing test users from Supabase
- [ ] Clear browser cache/cookies
- [ ] Sign up with new email ‚Üí Should work immediately
- [ ] Login with new credentials ‚Üí Should work
- [ ] Complete profile setup ‚Üí Should redirect to dashboard
- [ ] No "check your email" message should appear

After enabling email confirmations with SMTP:

- [ ] Send test email from Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Sign up ‚Üí Check email (including spam folder)
- [ ] Click confirmation link ‚Üí Should redirect to app
- [ ] Login ‚Üí Should work after confirmation

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Invalid credentials" persists after fix
**Solution**: Delete the user and sign up again. The old user is marked as "unconfirmed" and cannot login.

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Email still not received with SMTP configured
**Check**:
1. SMTP credentials are correct
2. Email isn't in spam folder
3. Sender email is verified with your provider
4. Check Supabase logs: **Logs** ‚Üí **Auth**

### "Email rate limit exceeded"
**Solution**: You're using Supabase's default email service which has strict limits. Configure custom SMTP or wait 1 hour.

### Cannot delete users from dashboard
**Use SQL**:
```sql
-- Delete specific user
DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Delete all users (DANGER - development only!)
DELETE FROM auth.users;
```

Email Provider: Not needed (disabled)
Site URL: http://localhost:3002
